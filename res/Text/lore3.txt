5 There is a music box on the nightstand.You wind it up and a melody comes out.
A melody that can be called... bittersweet. It brings back memories of a bright
past, memories that will never be repeated, leaving behind a bitter feeling
that your life has been left somewhere behind. You pull yourself together and
stop the music box.
