9 On the shelve lies a piece of torn paper.
"I recently invited a friend of mine to dinner. He is a witch hunter just like
me. Everything was fine, we drank wine, joked, laughed, but when it was time
for him  to leave, he asked me to step aside with him for a couple of minutes.
This freak dared to claim that my wife is somehow strange, that she could be
a witch, and that I need to be on my guard and check her out. He lives with
an old crone, that's why he's jealous. If he even tries to set the brotherhood
of hunters on my house, I'll kill every last one of them!"
Looks like an extract from a diary.
