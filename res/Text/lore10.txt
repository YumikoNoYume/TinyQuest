11 There is a note on the shelf.
"Something is wrong with my faithful dog Fork. Everything was fine, but at
some point it was as if it had been replaced. Fork became too aggressive, 
rushes at everyone, does not obey my commands at all. I thought maybe
it got hurt during the last hunt, I wanted to examine, but it bit me.
Isobel ran right away, treated my wound and said that she would think of
something to help Fork. The next morning the dog was calm and behaved almost
as before, but there was something wrong with its eyes. As if made of glass
I asked Isobel what she did, but she only joked that she gave the dog
valerian infusion to drink. It's all strange."
It looks like an extract from a diary.
