"I can't do that! I can't kill her, because I love her so much! I dreamed of a
happy family, of warm evenings, of us... But now all this is gone.
The Brotherhood started the hunt for Isobel and I... I must protect her, no
matter what it costs me. My old family has been passing a blade that is capable
of killing even the strongest and most powerful witches from generation to
generation. I can't let hunters get it. I built this fountain with the strongest
acid I could getand threw the blade into it. Now no one can kill Isobel!"
Looks like an extract from a diary.
