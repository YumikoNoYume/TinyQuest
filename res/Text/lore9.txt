14 In the nightstand you found a piece of paper.
"I can't believe this is happening to me! This is a nightmare! I started
noticing strange things in our house after that damn dinner, I started
to doubt and started checking everything. And what did it lead me to?
Statues in the garden? It turns out that people have been disappearing in
the city, and who? Those who are depicted by the statues! Those strange
music boxes, Isobel's secrets. I asked her if she was a witch, and she
admitted that she was! That the statues were the missing people, but they
were rogues and swindlers, so it's better for the city. The dog, according
to Isobel, was cursed during a hunt, and she found nothing better to do
than bewitch him! Now it is clear why Isobel is so good at potion-making
and why she understands magic, although she has never attended an academy.
As a witch hunter, I must kill her..."
Oh...
