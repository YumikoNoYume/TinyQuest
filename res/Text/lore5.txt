9 In the nightstand you found a letter.
"And so I finally built this huge house for my family. Of course, for now there
are only three of us: me, a witch hunter, my wife Isobel, a herbalist, and a dog
Fork, but I dream of a big and friendly family! I dream of warm evenings with
friends, of me and my beautiful Isobel spent the whole life together, of
children's laughter within the walls of the house! Mother, I am happy that I will
finally get what I wanted to get for so long. Come visit us for a couple of weeks.
With love, your son, Larry."
The letter was never sent. But why?
