13 In the nightstand you found a piece of paper. It looks like a page from some book.
"Nightmare witches are one of the most dangerous types of witches. They can live
peacefully among people for decades and remain unnoticed. They feed on
nightmares, doubts, sadness, fear of people living around them. Once in a
while, they kidnap people to sacrifice them to their deity or, according to another
version, to eat their flesh and stay young. Do not be fooled by such a simple
description of these creatures, yes, they may not seem so dangerous in
life, but may the heavens have mercy on those next to whom the witch met her death.
After death, the body of the witches turns into a mummy and begins to exude
negative energy accumulated during life, poisoning fertile lands, the minds of
animals and people. The lands become cursed and this curse spreads to
everyone, even to passing caravans. The only known way to destroy the Nightmare
Witch's mummy is to stab it with a blade of enchanted obsidian."
