13 In the nightstand you found a piece of paper.
"Our house has a large garden that I arranged for my future large family.
The sun's rays are playing in the treetops, the birds are singing, the
fountain's water is babbling pleasantly. Such a pleasent view! One day, 
Isobel came to me and said that she wanted several statues for our garden
to make it even more beautiful. I said that it would not be easy, but I
would try to do something, but she replied that she knew an architect who
was ready to bring her idea to life. And a couple of days later, when I
returned home after a witch hunt, there were already statues in the garden!
And the most amazing thing is that the statues were so realistic: when I
look at the statues, it seems to me that they are resembling people I saw
in town."
Looks like an extract from a diary.
