8 On the shelve with various utensils lies a piece of paper.
"My job is not easy, how lucky I am that Isobel is a herbalist and good at
brewing potions. It is not the first time she saves me with healing potions.
I decided to ask her to brew some special protection potion for me, because
now my brothers and I are fighting a very dangerous witch who has acid magic.
I do not really want to go home with burns: I will scare Isobel with my
appearance."
Looks like an extract from a diary.
