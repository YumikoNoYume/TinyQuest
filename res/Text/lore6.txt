6 There is a music box on the nightstand. You wind it up and a melody comes out.
A melody that can be called... intensifying. It makes you imagine a sunny day
and a sun-drenched meadow. But the longer you imagine this picture, the
stranger it becomes: in the distance you can see pitch-black thunderclouds, in
the stream you notice dead fish, and instead of poppies... you imagine blood
stains. You pull yourself together and stop the box.
